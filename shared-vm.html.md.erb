# Shared-VM Plan

An instance of this plan, provisions a single Redis process, on a single **shared VM**, which is suitable for development workloads.

We **do not** recommend using this in a production environment.

Data persistence is enabled through the use of `RDB` and `AOF`.

## Operator Notes
This plan can be disabled by setting the `Max instances limit` on the `Shared-VM Plan` tab in OpsManager to be `0`.

## Known Limitations

Limitations with the current `shared-vm` plan include:

* It cannot be scaled beyond a single virtual machine.
* It has no backup and restore capabilities.
* The following commands are disabled: `CONFIG`, `MONITOR`, `SAVE`, `BGSAVE`,
  `SHUTDOWN`, `BGREWRITEAOF`, `SLAVEOF`, `DEBUG`, and `SYNC`.
* Constraining CPU and/or disk usage is not supported.
